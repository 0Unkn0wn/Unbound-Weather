    Weather app powered by OpenWeather api and ip2location api.
    The default city that's selected is based on the ip of the user.
    Use instructions : simply type the name of the city you want to search in the search bar and press enter. The app will automatically update the weather.

## Aditiotional information
    In the zip there is a single file version as well that works independently and doesn't require the user to have the .net platform installed.

    Packages used:
    1.Newtonsoft.Json for json deserialization
    2.ReactiveUi to update fields.
    3.RestSharp for async to make asynchronous HTTP calls to the used apias.
